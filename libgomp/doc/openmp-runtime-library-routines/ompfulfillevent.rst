  .. _omp_fulfill_event:

omp_fulfill_event -- Fulfill and destroy an OpenMP event
********************************************************

:samp:`{Description}:`
  Fulfill the event associated with the event handle argument.  Currently, it
  is only used to fulfill events generated by detach clauses on task
  constructs - the effect of fulfilling the event is to allow the task to
  complete.

  The result of calling ``omp_fulfill_event`` with an event handle other
  than that generated by a detach clause is undefined.  Calling it with an
  event handle that has already been fulfilled is also undefined.
