; Built-in functions in this file are organized into "stanzas", where
; all built-ins in a given stanza are enabled together.  Each stanza
; starts with a line identifying the circumstances in which the group of
; functions is permitted, with the gating predicate in square brackets.
; This is the only information allowed on the stanza header line, other
; than whitespace.
;
; Following the stanza header are two lines for each function: the
; prototype line and the attributes line.  The prototype line has
; this format, where the square brackets indicate optional
; information and angle brackets indicate required information:
;
;   [kind] <return-type> <bif-name> (<argument-list>);
;
; Here [kind] can be one of "const", "pure", or "fpmath";
; <return-type> is a legal type for a built-in function result;
; <bif-name> is the name by which the function can be called;
; and <argument-list> is a comma-separated list of legal types
; for built-in function arguments.  The argument list may be
; empty, but the parentheses and semicolon are required.
;
; A legal type is of the form:
;
;   [const] [[signed|unsigned] <basetype> | <vectype>] [*]
;
; where "const" applies only to a <basetype> of "int".  Legal values
; of <basetype> are (for now):
;
;   char
;   short
;   int
;   long long
;   float
;   double
;   __int128
;   _Float128
;   _Decimal32
;   _Decimal64
;   _Decimal128
;   __ibm128
;
; Legal values of <vectype> are as follows, and are shorthand for
; the associated meaning:
;
;   vsc		vector signed char
;   vuc		vector unsigned char
;   vbc		vector bool char
;   vss		vector signed short
;   vus		vector unsigned short
;   vbs		vector bool short
;   vsi		vector signed int
;   vui		vector unsigned int
;   vbi		vector bool int
;   vsll	vector signed long long
;   vull	vector unsigned long long
;   vbll	vector bool long long
;   vsq		vector signed __int128
;   vuq		vector unsigned __int128
;   vbq		vector bool __int128
;   vp		vector pixel
;   vf		vector float
;   vd		vector double
;   vop		opaque vector (matches all vectors)
;
; For simplicity, We don't support "short int" and "long long int".
; We don't currently support a <basetype> of "bool", "long double",
; or "_Float16".  "signed" and "unsigned" only apply to integral base
; types.  The optional * indicates a pointer type, which can be used
; only with "void" and "const char" in this file.  (More specific
; pointer types are allowed in overload prototypes.)
;
; The attributes line looks like this:
;
;   <bif-id> <bif-pattern> {<attribute-list>}
;
; Here <bif-id> is a unique internal identifier for the built-in
; function that will be used as part of an enumeration of all
; built-in functions; <bif-pattern> is the define_expand or
; define_insn that will be invoked when the call is expanded;
; and <attribute-list> is a comma-separated list of special
; conditions that apply to the built-in function.  The attribute
; list may be empty, but the braces are required.
;
; Attributes are strings, and the allowed ones are listed below.
;
;   init     Process as a vec_init function
;   set      Process as a vec_set function
;   extract  Process as a vec_extract function
;   nosoft   Not valid with -msoft-float
;   ldvec    Needs special handling for vec_ld semantics
;   stvec    Needs special handling for vec_st semantics
;   reve     Needs special handling for element reversal
;   pred     Needs special handling for comparison predicates
;   htm      Needs special handling for transactional memory
;   htmspr   HTM function using an SPR
;   htmcr    HTM function using a CR
;   mma      Needs special handling for MMA
;   no32bit  Not valid for TARGET_32BIT
;   cpu      This is a "cpu_is" or "cpu_supports" builtin
;   ldstmask Altivec mask for load or store
;   lxvr     Needs special handling for load-rightmost
;
; Each attribute corresponds to extra processing required when
; the built-in is expanded.  All such special processing should
; be controlled by an attribute from now on.
;
; It is important to note that each entry's <bif-name> must be
; unique.  The code generated from this file will call def_builtin
; for each entry, and this can only happen once per name.  This
; means that in some cases we currently retain some tricks from
; the old builtin support to aid with overloading.  This 
; unfortunately seems to be necessary for backward compatibility.
;
; The two tricks at our disposal are the void pointer and the "vop"
; vector type.  We use void pointers anywhere that pointer types
; are accepted (primarily for vector load/store built-ins).  In
; practice this means that we accept pointers to anything, not
; just to the types that we intend.  We use the "vop" vector type
; anytime that a built-in must accept vector types that have
; different modes.  This is an opaque type that will match any
; vector type, which may mean matching vector types that we don't
; intend.
;
; We can improve on "vop" when a vector argument or return type is
; limited to one mode.  For example, "vsll" and "vull" both map to
; V2DImode.  In this case, we can arbitrarily pick one of the
; acceptable types to use in the prototype.  The signature used by
; def_builtin is based on modes, not types, so this works well.
; Only use "vop" when there is no alternative.  When there is a
; choice, best practice is to use the signed type ("vsll" in the
; example above) unless the choices are unsigned and bool, in
; which case the unsigned type should be used.
;
; Eventually we want to automatically generate built-in documentation
; from the entries in this file.  Documenting of built-ins with more
; than one acceptable prototype can be done by cross-referencing
; against rs6000-overload.def and picking up the allowable prototypes
; from there.
;
; Blank lines may be used as desired in this file between the lines as
; defined above; that is, you can introduce as many extra newlines as you
; like after a required newline, but nowhere else.  Lines beginning with
; a semicolon are also treated as blank lines.
;
; A const int argument may be restricted to certain values.  This is
; indicated by one of the following occurring after the "int" token:
;
;    <x>   restricts the constant to x bits, interpreted as unsigned
;    <x,y> restricts the constant to the inclusive range [x,y]
;    [x,y] restricts the constant to the inclusive range [x,y],
;	   but only applies if the argument is constant.
;    {x,y} restricts the constant to one of two values, x or y.
;
; Here x and y are integer tokens.  Note that the "const" token is a
; lie when the restriction is [x,y], but this simplifies the parsing
; significantly and is hopefully forgivable.
