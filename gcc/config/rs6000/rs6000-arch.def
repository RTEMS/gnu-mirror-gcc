/* This file defines architecture features that are based on the -mcpu=<proc>
   option, and not on user options that can be turned on or off.  The intention
   is for newer processors (power7 and above) to not add new ISA bits for the
   particular processor, but add these bits.  Otherwise we have to add a bunch
   of hidden options, just so we have the proper ISA bits.

   For example, in the past we added -mpower8-internal, so that on power8,
   power9, and power10 would inherit the option, but we had to mark the option
   generate a warning if the user actually used it.  These options have been
   moved from the ISA flags to the arch flags.

   To use this, define the macro ARCH_EXPAND which takes 2 arguments.  The
   first argument is the processor name in upper case, and the second argument
   is a text name for the processor.

   The function get_arch_flags when passed a processor index number will set up
   the appropriate architecture flags based on the actual processor
   enumeration.  */
