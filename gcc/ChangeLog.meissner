==================== Dmf004 branch, patch #3.

Update float 128-bit conversions, PR target/107299.

This patch fixes two tests that are still failing when long double is IEEE
128-bit after the previous 2 patches for PR target/107299 have been applied.
The tests are:

	gcc.target/powerpc/convert-fp-128.c
	gcc.target/powerpc/pr85657-3.c

This patch is a rewrite of the patch submitted on August 18th:

| https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2022-August/599988.html

This patch reworks the conversions between 128-bit binary floating point types.
Previously, we would call rs6000_expand_float128_convert to do all conversions.
Now, we only define the conversions between the same representation that turn
into a NOP.  The appropriate extend or truncate insn is generated, and after
register allocation, it is converted to a move.

This patch also fixes two places where we want to override the external name
for the conversion function, and the wrong optab was used.  Previously,
rs6000_expand_float128_convert would handle the move or generate the call as
needed.  Now, it lets the machine independent code generate the call.  But if
we use the machine independent code to generate the call, we need to update the
name for two optabs where a truncate would be used in terms of converting
between the modes.  This patch updates those two optabs.

I tested this patch on:

    1)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ieee
    2)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ibm
    3)	LE Power9  using --with-cpu=power9  --with-long-double-format=ibm
    4)	BE Power8  using --with-cpu=power8  --with-long-double-format=ibm

In the past I have also tested this exact patch on the following systems:

    1)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power9  --with-long-double-format=ibm
    2)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power8  --with-long-double-format=ibm
    3)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ibm

There were no regressions in the bootstrap process or running the tests (after
applying all 3 patches for PR target/107299).  Can I check this patch into the
trunk?

==================== Dmf004 branch, patch #2.

Make __float128 use the _Float128 type, PR target/107299.

This patch fixes the issue that GCC cannot build when the default long double
is IEEE 128-bit.  It fails in building libgcc, specifically when it is trying
to buld the __mulkc3 function in libgcc.  It is failing in gimple-range-fold.cc
during the evrp pass.  Ultimately it is failing because the code declared the
type to use TFmode but it used F128 functions (i.e. KFmode).

	typedef float TFtype __attribute__((mode (TF)));
	typedef __complex float TCtype __attribute__((mode (TC)));

	TCtype
	__mulkc3_sw (TFtype a, TFtype b, TFtype c, TFtype d)
	{
	  TFtype ac, bd, ad, bc, x, y;
	  TCtype res;

	  ac = a * c;
	  bd = b * d;
	  ad = a * d;
	  bc = b * c;

	  x = ac - bd;
	  y = ad + bc;

	  if (__builtin_isnan (x) && __builtin_isnan (y))
	    {
	      _Bool recalc = 0;
	      if (__builtin_isinf (a) || __builtin_isinf (b))
		{

		  a = __builtin_copysignf128 (__builtin_isinf (a) ? 1 : 0, a);
		  b = __builtin_copysignf128 (__builtin_isinf (b) ? 1 : 0, b);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (c))
		    c = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, c);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (d))
		    d = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, d);
		  recalc = 1;
		}
	      if (__builtin_isinf (c) || __builtin_isinf (d))
		{

		  c = __builtin_copysignf128 (__builtin_isinf (c) ? 1 : 0, c);
		  d = __builtin_copysignf128 (__builtin_isinf (d) ? 1 : 0, d);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (a))
		    a = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, a);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (b))
		    b = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, b);
		  recalc = 1;
		}
	      if (!recalc
		  && (__builtin_isinf (ac) || __builtin_isinf (bd)
		      || __builtin_isinf (ad) || __builtin_isinf (bc)))
		{

		  if (__builtin_isnan (a))
		    a = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, a);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (b))
		    b = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, b);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (c))
		    c = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, c);
		  if (__builtin_isnan (d))
		    d = __builtin_copysignf128 (0, d);
		  recalc = 1;
		}
	      if (recalc)
		{
		  x = __builtin_inff128 () * (a * c - b * d);
		  y = __builtin_inff128 () * (a * d + b * c);
		}
	    }

	  __real__ res = x;
	  __imag__ res = y;
	  return res;
	}

Currently GCC uses the long double type node for __float128 if long double is
IEEE 128-bit.  It did not use the node for _Float128.

Originally this was noticed if you call the nansq function to make a signaling
NaN (nansq is mapped to nansf128).  Because the type node for _Float128 is
different from __float128, the machine independent code converts signaling NaNs
to quiet NaNs if the types are not compatible.  The following tests used to
fail when run on a system where long double is IEEE 128-bit:

	gcc.dg/torture/float128-nan.c
	gcc.target/powerpc/nan128-1.c

This patch makes both __float128 and _Float128 use the same type node.

One side effect of not using the long double type node for __float128 is that we
must only use KFmode for _Float128/__float128.  The libstdc++ library won't
build if we use TFmode for _Float128 and __float128 when long double is IEEE
128-bit.

Another minor side effect is that the f128 round to odd fused multiply-add
function will not merge negatition with the FMA operation when the type is long
double.  If the type is __float128 or _Float128, then it will continue to do the
optimization.  The round to odd functions are defined in terms of __float128
arguments.  For example:

	long double
	do_fms (long double a, long double b, long double c)
	{
	    return __builtin_fmaf128_round_to_odd (a, b, -c);
	}

will generate (assuming -mabi=ieeelongdouble):

	xsnegqp 4,4
	xsmaddqpo 4,2,3
	xxlor 34,36,36

while:

	__float128
	do_fms (__float128 a, __float128 b, __float128 c)
	{
	    return __builtin_fmaf128_round_to_odd (a, b, -c);
	}

will generate:

	xsmsubqpo 4,2,3
	xxlor 34,36,36

I tested all 3 patchs for PR target/107299 on:

    1)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ieee
    2)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ibm
    3)	LE Power9  using --with-cpu=power9  --with-long-double-format=ibm
    4)	BE Power8  using --with-cpu=power8  --with-long-double-format=ibm

Once all 3 patches have been applied, we can once again build GCC when long
double is IEEE 128-bit.  There were no other regressions with these patches.
Can I check these patches into the trunk?

==================== Dmf004 branch, patch #1.

Rework 128-bit complex multiply and divide.

This function reworks how the complex multiply and divide built-in functions are
done.  Previously we created built-in declarations for doing long double complex
multiply and divide when long double is IEEE 128-bit.  The old code also did not
support __ibm128 complex multiply and divide if long double is IEEE 128-bit.

In terms of history, I wrote the original code just as I was starting to test
GCC on systems where IEEE 128-bit long double was the default.  At the time, we
had not yet started mangling the built-in function names as a way to bridge
going from a system with 128-bit IBM long double to 128-bin IEEE long double.

The original code depends on there only being two 128-bit types invovled.  With
the next patch in this series, this assumption will no longer be true.  When
long double is IEEE 128-bit, there will be 2 IEEE 128-bit types (one for the
explicit __float128/_Float128 type and one for long double).

The problem is we cannot create two separate built-in functions that resolve to
the same name.  This is a requirement of add_builtin_function and the C front
end.  That means for the 3 possible modes (IFmode, KFmode, and TFmode), you can
only use 2 of them.

This code does not create the built-in declaration with the changed name.
Instead, it uses the TARGET_MANGLE_DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME hook to change the name
before it is written out to the assembler file like it now does for all of the
other long double built-in functions.

We need to disable using this mapping when we are building libgcc, specifically
when it is building the floating point 128-bit multiply and divide functions.
The flag that is used when libgcc is built (-fbuilding-libcc) is only available
in the C/C++ front ends.  We need to remember that we are building libgcc in the
rs6000-c.cc support to be able to use this later to decided whether to mangle
the decl assembler name or not.

When I wrote these patches, I discovered that __ibm128 complex multiply and
divide had originally not been supported if long double is IEEE 128-bit as it
would generate calls to __mulic3 and __divic3.  I added tests in the testsuite
to verify that the correct name (i.e. __multc3 and __divtc3) is used in this
case.

I tested all 3 patchs for PR target/107299 on:

    1)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ieee
    2)	LE Power10 using --with-cpu=power10 --with-long-double-format=ibm
    3)	LE Power9  using --with-cpu=power9  --with-long-double-format=ibm
    4)	BE Power8  using --with-cpu=power8  --with-long-double-format=ibm

Once all 3 patches have been applied, we can once again build GCC when long
double is IEEE 128-bit.  There were no other regressions with these patches.
