(*
   findQuadratic - returns TRUE if a scalar values of x can be found
                   for.

                     2
                   ax  +  bx + c == 0
*)

PROCEDURE findQuadratic (a, b, c: REAL; VAR x0, x1: REAL) : BOOLEAN ;
   

(*
   findQuartic - returns TRUE if a scalar root can be found for:

                   4      3      2
                 ax  +  bx  +  cx  +  dx +  e  == 0

                 TRUE is only returned if a positive value for
                 x is found and it returns the smallest value for x.
*)

PROCEDURE findQuartic (a, b, c, d, e: REAL; VAR x: REAL) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   nearZero - returns TRUE if, r, is close to 0.0
*)

PROCEDURE nearZero (r: REAL) : BOOLEAN ;


END roots.
