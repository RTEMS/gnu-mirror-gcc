this is an example of how one might use GNU Modula-2 to produce a
Python library.  You will need to install python swig, python
development libraries, mencoder (mplayer), groff, convert, gs and
netpbm.

On Debian or Ubuntu you can:

$ sudo apt-get install groff imagemagick python3-dev swig gs netpbm mplayer
