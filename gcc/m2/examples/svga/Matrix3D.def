(*
   Init - creates a matrix and returns the matrix object.
*)

PROCEDURE Init () : Matrix ;


(*
   Kill - marks the matrix given to be deleted. This matrix is
          returned and the next time it is used it will be
          deleted.
*)

PROCEDURE Kill (m: Matrix) : Matrix ;


(*
   Del - deletes the matrix given whether or not it has been
         marked as killed.
*)

PROCEDURE Del (m: Matrix) ;


(*
   Set - sets the elements of a Matrix with the values.
*)

PROCEDURE Set (m: Matrix; v: MatrixValue) : Matrix ;


(*
   Get - gets the elements of a Matrix into value MatrixValues.
*)

PROCEDURE Get (m: Matrix; VAR v: MatrixValue) : Matrix ;


(*
   Add - adds m1 and m2 together and returns the result.
*)

PROCEDURE Add (m1, m2: Matrix) : Matrix ;


(*
   Mult - multiplies m1 and m2 together and returns the result.
*)

PROCEDURE Mult (m1, m2: Matrix) : Matrix ;
