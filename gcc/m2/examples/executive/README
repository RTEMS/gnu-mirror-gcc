Building
========

This can only be built once GNU Modula-2 has been installed.

To build type:

  make

Running
=======

To run try:

  ./testtime

which will start three processes which wait on a timer queue.  A 2,
5 and 20 second process.  Each process waits for its time to expire
and writes out a simple message. The test terminates after 30 seconds.

  ./winexec

displays three ncurses windows and writes text to two of them
contineously.  Any keyboard input will cause the third window (process)
to display text.  'p' displays a simple process status.  Type ^C to
terminate this example.

  ./testexecutive

creates two processes and context switches between them. Type ^C to
terminate this example.

Overview
========

These two examples show that an executive and simple application code
can be built on top of the SYSTEM process primitives NEWPROCESS,
TRANSFER and IOTRANSFER. The Executive and TimerHandler have been used
in a stand alone microkernel for many years and have had only minor
alterations to make them work with the GNU/Linux SYSTEM.
