Options for debugging your program or GNU Fortran
*************************************************

.. index:: options, debugging

.. index:: debugging information options

GNU Fortran has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or the GNU Fortran compiler.

.. option:: -fdump-fortran-original

  .. index:: fdump-fortran-original

  Output the internal parse tree after translating the source program
  into internal representation.  This option is mostly useful for
  debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by
  this option might change between releases. This option may also
  generate internal compiler errors for features which have only
  recently been added.

.. option:: -fdump-fortran-optimized

  .. index:: fdump-fortran-optimized

  Output the parse tree after front-end optimization.  Mostly useful for
  debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by
  this option might change between releases.  This option may also
  generate internal compiler errors for features which have only
  recently been added.

.. option:: -fdump-parse-tree

  .. index:: fdump-parse-tree

  Output the internal parse tree after translating the source program
  into internal representation.  Mostly useful for debugging the GNU
  Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by this option might
  change between releases. This option may also generate internal
  compiler errors for features which have only recently been added. This
  option is deprecated; use ``-fdump-fortran-original`` instead.

.. option:: -fdebug-aux-vars

  .. index:: fdebug-aux-vars

  Renames internal variables created by the gfortran front end and makes
  them accessible to a debugger.  The name of the internal variables then
  start with upper-case letters followed by an underscore.  This option is
  useful for debugging the compiler's code generation together with
  ``-fdump-tree-original`` and enabling debugging of the executable
  program by using ``-g`` or ``-ggdb3``.

.. option:: -fdump-fortran-global

  .. index:: fdump-fortran-global

  Output a list of the global identifiers after translating into
  middle-end representation. Mostly useful for debugging the GNU Fortran
  compiler itself. The output generated by this option might change
  between releases.  This option may also generate internal compiler
  errors for features which have only recently been added.

.. option:: -ffpe-trap=list

  .. index:: ffpe-trap=list

  Specify a list of floating point exception traps to enable.  On most
  systems, if a floating point exception occurs and the trap for that
  exception is enabled, a SIGFPE signal will be sent and the program
  being aborted, producing a core file useful for debugging.  :samp:`{list}`
  is a (possibly empty) comma-separated list of the following
  exceptions: :samp:`invalid` (invalid floating point operation, such as
  ``SQRT(-1.0)`` ), :samp:`zero` (division by zero), :samp:`overflow`
  (overflow in a floating point operation), :samp:`underflow` (underflow
  in a floating point operation), :samp:`inexact` (loss of precision
  during operation), and :samp:`denormal` (operation performed on a
  denormal value).  The first five exceptions correspond to the five
  IEEE 754 exceptions, whereas the last one (:samp:`denormal`) is not
  part of the IEEE 754 standard but is available on some common
  architectures such as x86.

  The first three exceptions (:samp:`invalid`, :samp:`zero`, and
  :samp:`overflow`) often indicate serious errors, and unless the program
  has provisions for dealing with these exceptions, enabling traps for
  these three exceptions is probably a good idea.

  If the option is used more than once in the command line, the lists will
  be joined: '  ``ffpe-trap=``:samp:`{list1}`  ``ffpe-trap=``:samp:`{list2}` '
  is equivalent to  ``ffpe-trap=``:samp:`{list1}`, :samp:`{list2}`.

  Note that once enabled an exception cannot be disabled (no negative form).

  Many, if not most, floating point operations incur loss of precision
  due to rounding, and hence the ``ffpe-trap=inexact`` is likely to
  be uninteresting in practice.

  By default no exception traps are enabled.

.. option:: -ffpe-summary=list

  .. index:: ffpe-summary=list

  Specify a list of floating-point exceptions, whose flag status is printed
  to ``ERROR_UNIT`` when invoking ``STOP`` and ``ERROR STOP``.
  :samp:`{list}` can be either :samp:`none`, :samp:`all` or a comma-separated list
  of the following exceptions: :samp:`invalid`, :samp:`zero`, :samp:`overflow`,
  :samp:`underflow`, :samp:`inexact` and :samp:`denormal`. (See
  :option:`-ffpe-trap` for a description of the exceptions.)

  If the option is used more than once in the command line, only the
  last one will be used.

  By default, a summary for all exceptions but :samp:`inexact` is shown.

.. option:: -fno-backtrace

  .. index:: fno-backtrace

  .. index:: backtrace

  .. index:: trace

  When a serious runtime error is encountered or a deadly signal is
  emitted (segmentation fault, illegal instruction, bus error,
  floating-point exception, and the other POSIX signals that have the
  action :samp:`core`), the Fortran runtime library tries to output a
  backtrace of the error. ``-fno-backtrace`` disables the backtrace
  generation. This option only has influence for compilation of the
  Fortran main program.

See :ref:`Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC <debugging-options>`, for more information on
debugging options.
