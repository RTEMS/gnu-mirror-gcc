.. index:: extensions

The two sections below detail the extensions to standard Fortran that are
implemented in GNU Fortran, as well as some of the popular or
historically important extensions that are not (or not yet) implemented.
For the latter case, we explain the alternatives available to GNU Fortran
users, including replacement by standard-conforming code or GNU
extensions.
