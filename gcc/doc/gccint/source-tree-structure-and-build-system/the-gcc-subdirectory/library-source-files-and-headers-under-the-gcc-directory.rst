Library Source Files and Headers under the gcc Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FIXME: list here, with explanation, all the C source files and headers
under the :samp:`gcc` directory that aren't built into the GCC
executable but rather are part of runtime libraries and object files,
such as :samp:`crtstuff.c` and :samp:`unwind-dw2.c`.  See :ref:`Headers Installed by GCC <headers>`, for more information about the
:samp:`ginclude` directory.
