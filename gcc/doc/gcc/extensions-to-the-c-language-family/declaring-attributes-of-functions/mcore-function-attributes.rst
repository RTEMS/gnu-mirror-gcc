MCORE Function Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These function attributes are supported by the MCORE back end:

.. option:: naked

  .. index:: naked function attribute, MCORE

  This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
  requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
  function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
  prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
  ``asm`` statements can safely be included in naked functions
  (see :ref:`basic-asm`). While using extended ``asm`` or a mixture of
  basic ``asm`` and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
  depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.
